# Files-Renamer
This mini python script will rename the content of any folder on your computer. Simply copy and paste the directory of any folder you want into the RT Directory.txt, and run the script.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> keep the python file and the .txt file in the same folder or desktop. 

The script will turn files such as "IMG_221, IMG_222" into for example "Portrait 1, Portrait 2"

This is merely a tool used for organization of file names nothing more or less.
